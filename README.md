### About Myself 👋
Hi! My name is Ali Onur Ülker.
I am interested in Web Design and Programming since 2013. My software adventure started in high school computer classes. I have been to a high school that has an information technologies department. And then, I started my university life at the Computer Science Department of Sakarya University. I participated in the Erasmus program in October 2018. And, I finished my education for two semesters at the University of Rzeszów in Poland. I made an internship as a web application developer in Enka Systems. At the moment, I am working as a full-stack developer on a lot of projects at Advancity. Finally, I have experience with web applications and I want to continue to further build on it in more worthy places. Such a pleasure to code to design and manage events according to your mind on the web.

This is a brief summary of my software life so far.
